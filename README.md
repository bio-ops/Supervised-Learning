**Universalbank2.csv**

*Data Background*

In this exercise, you are asked to create a decision tree model on the Universal Bank dataset. 
Universal Bank is a relatively young bank growing rapidly in terms of overall customer acquisition. 
The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of relationship 
with the bank. The customer base of asset customers (borrowers) is quite small, and the bank is 
interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business. 
In particular, it wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers 
(while retaining them as depositors). The retail marketing department consider to devise smarter 
campaigns with better target marketing. The goal is predict whether a new customer will accept a 
loan offer. This will serve as the basis for the design of a new campaign. 
The file UniversalBank2.csv contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer 
demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer’s relationship with the 
bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan 
campaign (Personal Loan).
